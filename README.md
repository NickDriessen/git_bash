At first, I made the README.txt, which I later renamed to README.md.

Then, I created the hello and calculator folders.

After creating the folders, I made the hello.sh file, where I put the "Hello, World!" Bash code.

Lastly, I created the calc.sh file in the calculator folder, where I tried to Google how to make a calculator.
But at first, I only found calculators that were self-made and didn't use the bc command.
So I asked ChatGPT for help and used the code it gave me.
Then, I asked why it changed ^ to ** and found out that ^ doesn't exist in the bc function and needed to be changed.
